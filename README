NAME
    Image::JpegTran::AutoRotate - Losslessly fix JPEG orientation

SYNOPSIS
        use Image::JpegTran::AutoRotate; # auto-exports auto_rotate

        auto_rotate('file.jpg'); # rotates in-place (via a temporary file)
        auto_rotate('from.jpg' => 'to.jpg'); # writes to another file

DESCRIPTION
    Transforms JPEG files so that orientation becomes 1.

    This is the same operation as "exifautotran", but with no dependencies
    on command-line programs; instead, we use the excellent Image::JpegTran
    and Image::ExifTool CPAN modules.
